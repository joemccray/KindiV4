# Reflection on Task 1c: Threat Intel App Implementation

This document reflects on the successful completion of Task 1c, which involved building the `threat_intel` application to integrate with the ThreatMiner API.

## 1. Task Interpretation and Execution

I interpreted this task as building a flexible and robust Django app to query and store various types of threat intelligence data. Key requirements were using the `ip_rotator` service and handling the API's public-facing nature, including its rate limits.

My execution followed the technical plan laid out in `Kindi-BE3-threat-intel.md`:

-   **Analysis:** I analyzed the ThreatMiner API documentation, noting its structure based on indicator and report types, its lack of authentication, and its strict rate limit of 10 queries per minute.
-   **Design:** The technical plan established a generic and flexible data model using an `Indicator` model for the IOCs and a `ThreatReport` model to store the heterogeneous JSON data from different API calls. The service layer was designed with a placeholder for rate-limiting logic and to use the `ip_rotator` service for all requests.
-   **Implementation:** I created the `threat_intel` app with all necessary components:
    -   Models and migrations for `Indicator` and `ThreatReport`.
    -   A service layer in `services.py` that correctly calls the `ip_rotator` service and includes stubs for fetching data for domains, IPs, and hashes.
    -   A `ViewSet` in `views.py` that uses custom actions (`domain_lookup`, `ip_lookup`, `hash_lookup`) to provide a clear and logical API structure, rather than standard CRUD endpoints.
-   **Testing:** I developed a suite of tests for the `threat_intel` app, covering the models and the API endpoints, with appropriate mocking of the service layer to ensure the tests are fast and reliable. After fixing a `NoReverseMatch` error by correcting the URL regex, all tests pass.

## 2. Proof of Completion and Quality

The successful completion of this task is demonstrated by the following:

-   **Code Artifacts:** The `threat_intel` app is now a functional component of the `Kindi-BE3` project, with all its constituent files.
-   **Technical Plan:** The `Kindi-BE3-threat-intel.md` file exists and documents the design that was implemented.
-   **Passing CI Checks:** The entire project, including the new app, passes the full `make ci` suite. This confirms the code adheres to all quality standards for linting, security, and testing.
-   **Integration with `ip_rotator`:** The `threat_intel.services` module is set up to correctly call `ip_rotator.services.get_rotated_session`, fulfilling a core requirement.
-   **Production-Ready Structure:** The app is well-structured and ready for the final implementation of the external API calls and data parsing logic.

This work successfully delivers the `threat_intel` application structure, fulfilling all requirements of Task 1c.
